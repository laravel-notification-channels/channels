## Installation

You can install the package via composer:

```bash
composer require laravel-notification-channels/pr0gramm
```

Next, you must load the service provider if you don't use auto-discovery:

```php
// config/app.php
'providers' => [
    // ...
    NotificationChannels\Pr0gramm\Pr0grammServiceProvider::class,
],
```

### Setting up the Pr0gramm service

It is recommended to use the credentials of a bot account, as you will not be able to solve the required captcha. You
can read more about the Pr0gramm-API and how to get your credentials [here](https://github.com/pr0gramm-com/api-docs/).

Next, you must add your Pr0gramm Credentials in `config/services.php`:

```php
// config/services.php
'pr0gramm' => [
	'username' => env('PR0GRAMM_USERNAME'),
	'password' => env('PR0GRAMM_PASSWORD'),
],
```

## Usage

In every model you wish to be notifiable via Pr0gramm, you must add a `getPr0grammName` method that returns the name of
the user on Pr0gramm.

```php
// app/Models/User.php
public function getPr0grammName(): string
{
	return $this->pr0grammName;
}
```

You can now use the channel in your `via()` method inside the notification (You can also use `'pr0gramm'` as channel
name)):

```php
use NotificationChannels\Pr0gramm\Pr0grammChannel;

public function via($notifiable)
{
	return [Pr0grammChannel::class];
}
```

Next, you must add a `toPr0gramm` method to your notification containing the message you wish to send to the user:

```php
public function toPr0gramm($notifiable): string
{
	return 'Message from Laravel';
}
```

> **NOTE - RATE LIMIT**: As the rate limit for sending messages is quite low, you will probably run into
> the `Pr0grammRateLimitReached`-Exception.
>
> You can handle this exception through your try catch block or when using the queue driver by adding a `failed`-method
> to your notification and release the job again.

That's it, you're ready to go!
